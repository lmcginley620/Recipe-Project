// We are hoping to make a recipe project. The user will be able to search a food or an item of a
food and see all the recipes that contain that food! If the user wants to add a new recipe into the
website there will be an add button that will allow the user to do so and then store the new recipe in our database.
There will be a search button that will prompt the user to enter a food item and then it will display a list of recipes
that contain that food, with descriptions of the recipes. If the user is not happy with the displayed recipes
it can add a better recipe in their eyes with an add button. The user will have an account and it will show all the

recipes that they have added. If they wish to remove a recipe they have added there will be a delete button allowing
them to do so. In
our SQL database we will SELECT a food item from our tables when we wish to display information about a food. We will
DELETE from our
table when a user wishes to delete a food recipe they’ve added. We will INSERT INTO when a user wishes to add a recipe
and we
will UPDATE when a user wishes to update a previous recipe they’ve added.
